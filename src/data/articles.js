    title: 'The Myth of Multitasking',
    description: 'Why Doing Less Helps You Achieve More',
    text: `Multitasking feels productive — you’re answering emails, scrolling, eating lunch, thinking about that meeting. But studies show your brain isn’t truly doing multiple things at once. It’s rapidly switching between tasks, and that switching costs energy, focus, and quality.
The truth? Multitasking lowers efficiency by up to 40% and increases stress.
Instead, try:
Choosing one priority at a time.
Setting a 20-minute focus window (try the Rainbow Focus timer!).
Letting yourself deep dive without distraction.
✨ Focus isn’t a talent. It’s a habit. And it starts with saying no to noise.`,

    title: 'The Cost of Interrupted Work',
    description: 'Why Distractions Are More Expensive Than You Think',
    text: `In the age of constant connectivity, it’s easy to underestimate the real cost of interruptions. We juggle Slack messages, email alerts, and back-to-back meetings, often without realizing how much productivity is slipping through the cracks. But science — and experience — tells us this multitasking culture comes at a steep price. Welcome to the world of interrupted work, where every distraction has a measurable cost.
    When you're deep into a task and get pulled away, it doesn't just pause your progress — it resets it. Research led by Professor Gloria Mark at UC Irvine found that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to return to the original task after an interruption. Even minor distractions can derail our focus, especially when we’re doing cognitively demanding work like writing, coding, designing, or strategizing.`,

    title: 'Why You Can’t Focus – It’s Not Your Fault',
    description: 'If you can’t focus, it’s probably not your fault.',
    text: `If you've ever sat down to do one thing and ended up doing twenty others — or nothing at all — you're not alone. Struggling to focus isn’t laziness, lack of willpower, or some personal failing. In fact, the modern world is designed to steal your attention, and it’s doing a disturbingly good job at it.
    We live in an age of constant digital distraction. Your phone buzzes. Your inbox pings. That Slack message dings. Every app, ad, and notification is fighting for a slice of your attention. And the worst part? These interruptions aren’t just annoying — they reprogram your brain.

Platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok are built to keep you scrolling, not to help you finish that report. These tools use sophisticated behavioral psychology to hijack your attention and reward short bursts of stimulation, rewiring your brain away from deep focus.`,

    title: 'Do Less: The Case for a More Focused, Fulfilling Life',
    description: 'You don’t need to do more. You need to do less — but better.',
    text: `We live in a productivity-obsessed world. Our calendars are packed, our to-do lists endless, and our attention scattered. We multitask, context-switch, and constantly chase the next thing — all in the name of being "efficient."

But what are we really getting done?
When everything is important, nothing is. When we say yes to everything, we dilute the time, energy, and focus we could give to what truly matters.
Doing less isn’t about being lazy. It’s about being intentional.

It means:
Fewer priorities, deeply pursued.
Less noise, more clarity.
Less busywork, more meaningful impact.
By removing the nonessential, we create space for the exceptional.`,
